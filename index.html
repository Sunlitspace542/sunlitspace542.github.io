				Helscome my wedsite.<br>
				Its not done.<br>
				<br>
				I've wanted my own janky website for a while.<br>
				I wrote a little test website a couple years ago, which is more or less what you're looking at now after quite a lot of cleanup.<br>
				All the old content was removed as I was just using it to learn HTML and CSS and it was nothing interesting.<br>
				I do have a Patreon that I kinda/sorta use as a blog, but I wanted something I could have a bit more control over. (e.g. I can add images in the text and stuff)
