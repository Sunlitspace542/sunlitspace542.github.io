						I more or less went crazy on redoing the styles, and now it's completely different from the old test site I wrote 2 years ago, lol.<br>
						I think it looks much better, though.<br>
						Working on adding sections concerning my various works over the years.<br>
						None of the links in that section work right now.

						I've wanted my own janky website for a while.<br>
						I wrote a little test website a couple years ago, which is more or less what you're looking at now after quite a lot of cleanup.<br>
						All the old content was removed as I was just using it to learn HTML and CSS and it was nothing interesting.<br>
						I do have a Patreon that I kinda/sorta use as a blog, but I wanted something I could have a bit more control over. (e.g. I can add images in the text and stuff)
