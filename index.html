					I more or less went crazy on redoing the styles, and now it's completely different from the old test site I wrote 2 years ago, lol. 
					I think it looks much better, though.<br>
					Working on adding sections concerning my various works over the years.<br>
					None of the links in that section work right now.<br>
					I'm still tweaking things to try to keep the site from getting mangled too much on phones and the like.

					I've wanted my own janky website for a while.<br>
					I wrote a little test website a couple years ago, which is more or less what you're looking at now after quite a lot of cleanup.<br>
					All the old content was removed as I was just using it to learn HTML and CSS and it was nothing interesting.<br>
					I do have a Patreon that I kinda/sorta use as a blog, but I wanted something I could have a bit more control over. (e.g. I can add images in the text and stuff)
