					helscome my wedsite.<br>
					its not done.<br>
					<br>
					I'm that plural dork on the internet that brings you such things as continued updates for Star Fox EX and progress updates on Star Fox CD.<br>
					Along with Monika, we together form Emerald Softworks.<br>
					<br>
					I'm a ROMhacker, probably best known for being the guy in charge of maintaining <a href="https://rhpz.org/499">Star Fox EX</a>, for being the lead developer of Star Fox CD, 
					and for otherwise making dumb space furry game hacks. I've been ROMhacking for about 5 years now.<br>
					I am not a binary hacker; I need a good disassembly/decompilation or source code to do any work.<br>
					<br>
					I frequently collaborate with <a href="https://x.com/kandowontu">Kandowontu</a>, and he otherwise usually drags me into his projects to compile something for him
					 or posts about me on his Twitter, which may be how you know I exist, lol.<br>
					<br>
					I am proficient in the 65816 assembly language (and some Super FX assembly), if that isn't obvious from the nonsense I usually make.<br>
					I have some C knowledge (trying to learn more), and I also know some JavaScript, Batch and Makefile language, along with a very tiny amount of Python. 
					I pretty much know at least <i>something</i> about any language i've encountered or needed to use in my work.
					<br><br>

				<h2><u>The Latest Nonsense</u></h2>

				<p>
					<b><u>September 26, 2025</u></b>
					<br><br>
					New release! <a href="https://rhpz.org/29534">PETSCII Robots Rumble Patch</a> is out!<br>
					Still not totally out of my predicament yet, but I was able to find time to work on something small.<br>
					I hope to return to Star Fox nonsense eventually.

					<b><u>July 19, 2025</u></b>
					<br><br>
					The <a href="portfolio.html">portfolio page</a> has been added.<br>
					This lists all my non-ROMhacking work, mostly tools that I wrote/otherwise bodged together for use in my ROMhacking work.<br>
					Looking into how to implement the blog section.<br>
					Also seeing if I can implement some sort of HTML include system so I don't have to update the navbar on every page every time I add one button.
				</p>
				<hr>
				<p>
					<b><u>July 17, 2025</u></b>
					<br><br>
					<a href="https://rhpz.org/27460">Star Fox Shindou Edition</a> is out! Go play it!!<br>
					In other news, the old Carrd page has been retired. This website is to act as its replacement.<br>
					All the links that were there have been moved to the <a href="links.html">links page</a>.<br>
					More pages coming soon.
				</p>
				<hr>
				<p>
					<b><u>July 16, 2025</u></b>
					<br><br>
					(UPDATE 6:55 PM EST: The Artwork and ROMHacks pages are finished!)<br>
					I more or less went crazy on redoing the styles, and now it's completely different from the old test site I wrote 2 years ago, lol. 
					I think it looks much better, though.<br>
					Working on adding sections concerning my various works over the years.<br>
					None of the links in that section work right now.<br>
					I'm still tweaking things to try to keep the site from getting mangled too much on phones and the like.

					<b><u>July 15, 2025</u></b>
					<br><br>
					I've wanted my own janky website for a while.<br>
					I wrote a little test website a couple years ago, which is more or less what you're looking at now after quite a lot of cleanup.<br>
					All the old content was removed as I was just using it to learn HTML and CSS and it was nothing interesting.<br>
					I do have a Patreon that I kinda/sorta use as a blog, but I wanted something I could have a bit more control over. (e.g. I can add images in the text and stuff)
