				<p>
					This page lists all my non-ROMhacking programming work over the years.<br>
					This page mostly consists of all the tools and other such utility programs I have made for use in my ROMhacking work.<br>
					<br>
					Disclosure:<br>
					I often use AI tools to write smaller single purpose tools and/or the basic scaffolding for them, 
					and I then take that and clean it up and make it actually work.<br>
					Much of my work on these tools usually goes into figuring out the data formats and/or tying them all together 
					if they are to be used as script components.<br>

						<h2>[PC] <a href="https://github.com/Sunlitspace542/FastFX">FastFX</a></h2>
						<p>
							A Blender plugin for importing/exporting and editing shapes (models) for use in Star Fox 1 and 2.<br>
							<br>
							This tool was intended to act as my own replacement for Euclidium98's Model to FX, which I felt was very clunky and had room for improvement. 
							I ended up with something that saves quite a bit of time in the modelling process, and it is now being actively used in Star Fox CD and Star Fox EX.<br>
							It's still not completely independent, as for most uses it still depends on Argonaut Software's own SHAPED model editor/converter tool to 
							prepare the exported data for use in game.<br>
							<br>
							I spent several weeks reverse engineering the various formats it now supports:<br>
							<ul>
								<li>
									ASM BSP - text format used in Star Fox 1/2 to define shapes, FastFX can export to this format, though it does not support animation export or generating BSP trees for face sorting.
								</li>
								<li>
									ASM GZS - similar to above, but face sorting is much worse and BSP trees are not used. Animation export for this format is not supported.
								</li>
								<li>
									Fundoshi-Kun - Slightly modified version of the <a href="https://paulbourke.net/dataformats/geo/">Videoscape 3DG1 (GEO)</a> format.
								</li>
								<li>
									Animated Fundoshi-Kun (3DAN/3DGI) - Similar to regular Fundoshi-Kun, but animated - works, but the user may need to reorder the BSP frame jump table after converting with SHAPED
								</li>
							</ul>
							Work I did for this tool:
							<ul>
								<li>
									Reverse engineering - staring at data long enough until I figured most of it out
								</li>
								<li>
									Programming - ChatGPT wrote the basic outline, I took that and modified it to make it actually work, I also made Euclidium's Super FX material work as Python code
								</li>

						<h2>[PC] <a href="https://github.com/Sunlitspace542/65816-superfx-asm-argonaut-vscode">Argonaut 65816/Super FX Language Support for VS Code</a></h2>
						<p>
							A Visual Studio Code extension that adds 65816 and Super FX assembly (Argonaut Syntax) support, with additional 
							support for the directives used in Argonaut Software's SASM and ArgSfx assembler family.<br>
							It also adds tooltips for Super FX instructions that describe the instruction and provides detailed information on usage and flags affected/cycles, 
							based on a BRIEF editor macro Argonaut originally used during the development of Star Fox 1/2.<br>
							<br>
							Work I did for this tool:
							<ul>
								<li>
									Programming - writing TMLanguage files for syntax highlighting
								</li>
								<li>
									Documentation - filling in missing Super FX instruction information
								</li>
							</ul>

						<h2>[PC] <a href="https://github.com/Sunlitspace542/ultrastarfox/tree/main/TOOLS/bgconv">bgconv/Star Fox Background Maker 9000</a> </h2>
						<p>
							A set of scripts that calls on a combination of other tools to convert 512x512 PNGs into Star Fox compatible CGX/SCR/COL data for use in game.
						</p>
						Work I did for this tool:
						<ul>
							<li>
								Scripting - Writing the batch to tie everything together
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<h2>[PC] <a href="https://github.com/Sunlitspace542/ultrastarfox/tree/main/TOOLS/bgconv">bgoptimize/Star Fox Background Optimizer 9000</a> </h2>
						<p>
							A set of scripts that calls on a combination of other tools to convert a 512x512 PNG with its .PAL format palette 
							into an optimized CGX tileset and SCR tilemap.<br>
							Originally made for use with the original Star Fox graphics assets and otherwise handmade graphics assets to 
							optimize them so they crunch (compress) to a smaller size to save space.<br>
						</p>
						Work I did for this tool:
						<ul>
							<li>
								Scripting - Writing the batch to tie everything together
							</li>
						</ul>

						<h2>[PC] <a href="https://github.com/Sunlitspace542/ultrastarfox/tree/main/TOOLS/mapdec_src">mapdec/argonautmapdecoder</a> </h2>
						<p>
							A program that can read .MAP linker address files generated by the ArgAsm-Super FX (ArgSfx) assembler by Argonaut Software 
							and output a file containing all of the symbols in a human-readable format.<br>
							Originally written after migrating UltraStarFox/Star Fox EX from SASM to ArgSfx so we could take advantage of the more detailed symbol output for debugging.<br>
						</p>
						Work I did for this tool:
						<ul>
							<li>
								Reverse engineering - figuring out the symbol data format
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<h2>[PC] <a href="https://github.com/Sunlitspace542/ultrastarfox/tree/main/TOOLS/extend_src">extend/ROM Extender</a> </h2>
						<p>
							A program that extends a Super NES ROM image to a certain size in megabits, and fills the empty space with a specified padding byte.
						</p>
						Work I did for this tool:
						<ul>
							<li>
								Programming
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<h2>[PC] <a href="https://github.com/Sunlitspace542/ultrastarfox/tree/main/TOOLS/palconv_src">palconv</a> </h2>
						<p>
							A program that can convert SNES palette files between .PAL (raw CGRAM) and Nintendo's .COL and .SCL formats.
						</p>
						Work I did for this tool:
						<ul>
							<li>
								Reverse engineering - figuring out the data format
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<h2>[SNES] <a href="https://github.com/Sunlitspace542/SNES-MSU-1-Driver/tree/main">MSU-1 music driver/data streaming library</a> </h2>
						<p>
							A library written to make using the MSU-1 expansion audio chip for music playback and data streaming easier.<br>
							Originally written for Star Fox CD, and then open-sourced once it was deemed stable.<br>
							I also wrote <a href="https://github.com/Sunlitspace542/MSU-1-Docs">general-purpose documentation of the chip and its data formats including example code</a>, 
							as I was frustrated with the lack of up-to date documentation of the hardware and the minimal amount of existing sample code.
						</p>
						Work I did for this library:
						<ul>
							<li>
								Reverse engineering - Disassembling existing MSU-1 software and studying emulator code to gain a better understanding of the hardware
							</li>
							<li>
								Programming - The whole thing
							</li>
						</ul>
